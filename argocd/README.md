# Argo CD Bootstrap

This directory contains the top-level Argo CD bootstrap manifest and supporting documents.

- `bootstrap-application.yaml` installs an app-of-apps targeting the `argocd/apps` directory in this repository.
- `apps/` holds individual Argo CD `Application` or `AppProject` definitions that the bootstrap will reconcile automatically.
	- `azure-service-operator.yaml` installs Azure Service Operator v2 via Helm and consumes the Git-tracked values in `values/azure-service-operator.yaml`.
	- `gw-api-envoy.yaml` deploys the upstream Envoy Gateway Helm chart while sourcing overrides from `values/envoy-gateway.yaml`.
	- `cert-manager.yaml` installs the upstream cert-manager Helm chart with CRDs to satisfy Azure Service Operator dependencies.
- `values/` stores Helm values files generated by Terraform for reuse across applications.
